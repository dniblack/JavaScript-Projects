# HTML-CSS-Projects
I will be using this repository for all of my coding projects while I take the Javascript course from The Tech Academy

Here, I will be learning and putting into practice all the information I learn about JavaScript and creating projects based off that knowledge. You can see those projects here.

<h3>Pizza Menu</h3>
<br>
<p>This is a project that shows how to use JavaScript to select multiple items from a menu that calculates orders. As the items are being selected, the menu makes note and once all the items are selected and the order is submitted, a final price is calculated and given to the user.</p>
<br>
<h3>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h3>
<br>
<p>This project is to showcase making a Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game picks between two players by rolling a dice. From there, the two players of the game can choose between being either an X or an O. Each player has a turn at going until one of the players get 3 of their icons in a row or the game ends in a tie.
<br>
<h3>Calculator</h3>
<br>
<p>This project is to showcase how JavaScript can be used to make a basic calculator. The calculator is a simple 4 function calculator (add, subtract, multiply, and divide) and works like any other calculator</p>
